ESP32-LED-Controller
The goal is to make a LED Controller to replace the default one shipped with my
led strips.

I plan to utilize the ESP32 microcontroller due to its low cost, large memory
size, and built in Bluetooth and Wi-Fi

Plan:
1.Build a power converter to prevent killing the chip
2.Create a few simple displays to test functions and compatibility
3.Introduce BT communication (cannot connect a microcontroller to school Wi-Fi)
  this will serve as the way to control the device.
4.Create various display functions
Stretch: May introduce music reactivity with the MSGEQ7 color organ IC
